The Tungabhadra River (Kannada: [t̪uŋɡɐbʱɐd̪rɐ]) starts and flows through the state of Karnataka, India, during most of its course, then through Andhra Pradesh, and ultimately joins the Krishna River near Murvakonda in Andhra Pradesh.

The river Tungabhadra derives its name from two streams, viz., the Tunga, about 147 km (91 mi) long, and the Bhadra, about 178 km (111 mi) long, which rise in the Western Ghats. The river after the confluence of the two streams near Shimoga runs for about 531 km (330 mi) till it joins the river Krishna at Sangamaleshwaram in Andhra Pradesh. It runs for 382 km (237 mi) in Karnataka, forms the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for 58 km (36 mi) and further runs for the next 91 km (57 mi) in Andhra Pradesh. The total catchment area of the river is 69,552 km2 (26,854 sq mi) up to its confluence with Krishna and it is 28,177 km2 (10,879 sq mi) up to Tungabhadra Dam. It is influenced chiefly by the South-West monsoon. It is a perennial river, but the summer flows dwindle to as low as 2.83 to 1.42 cumec (100 to 50 cusec).[1]
